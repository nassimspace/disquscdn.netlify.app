# [Disqus CDN](https://disquscdn.netlify.app) | Disqus Mobile Template hosted on Netlify, meant to be used with the [Disqus-CDN web-component](https://github.com/nassimspace/disquscdn-web-component).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5ef6f731-8adc-4189-82c9-2d455b39df08/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/disquscdn/deploys)

## WHAT IS THIS?🤔

I used the [Disqus Mobile Template](https://github.com/disqus/DISQUS-API-Recipes/tree/master/mobile/js) and deployed it to Netlify: 

**https://disquscdn.netlify.app**

We pass the necessary variables to that page using query parameters.
Meant to be used with the [Disqus-CDN Web Component](https://codepen.io/nassimspace/pen/ExZpWVW), but also works without, AND, also works great with 
**AMP pages**! 

It is available to anyone who wishes to use this method -

Cheers!🍻

**NOTE**: "***url***" and "***id***" attributes should be unique and mirrored (1 url assigned to 1 id).
If you use an id for a url, **don't** reuse the id for another url and vice-versa, or else, it might create identifier conflicts.
More on that **[here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717138-why-are-the-same-comments-showing-up-on-multiple-pages)**.
